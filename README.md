# OpenTracing Spring Cloud
This repository provides OpenTracing instrumentation for Spring Cloud. It can be used with any OpenTracing
compatible implementation.

It contains auto-configurations for Spring Boot which will instrument and trace several Spring Cloud and other integrations:
* Spring Web (RestControllers, RestTemplates, WebAsyncTask)
* @Async, @Scheduled, Executors
* WebSocket STOMP
* Feign, HystrixFeign
* Hystrix
* JMS
* JDBC
* Zuul
* RxJava
* Standard logging - logs are added to active span
* Spring Messaging - trace messages being sent through [Messaging Channels](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/messaging-channels-section.html)

This library is compatible with [Spring Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/) `Camden.SR7`, `Dalston.SR3`
 and `Edgware.RELEASE`

## Comparison to `spring-cloud-sleuth`
This project is similar to [spring-cloud-sleuth](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth), 
both provide out of the box tracing solution for Spring Boot/Cloud. Some of the instrumentations in this 
package are based on original `sleuth` work.

However there are a couple of differences:
* OpenTracing support in `sleuth` is limited to one tracer implementation - [brave-opentracing](https://github.com/openzipkin-contrib/brave-opentracing). In other words it's not possible to use arbitrary OpenTracing tracer with `sleuth`.
* `sleuth` might support different set of instrumentations.
* Generated tracing data in `sleuth` follow Zipkin semantics e.g. `cs`, `cr`, `ss` annotations. This project complies with OpenTracing semantic conventions.

## Configuration
Just add the following dependency in your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.opentracing.contrib</groupId>
  <artifactId>opentracing-spring-cloud-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
, and provide OpenTracing tracer bean:
```java
@Bean
public io.opentracing.Tracer tracer() {
  return new // tracer instance of your choice (Zipkin, Jaeger, LightStep)
}
```

## Development
Maven checkstyle plugin is used to maintain consistent code style based on [Google Style Guides](https://github.com/google/styleguide)

```shell
./mvnw clean install
make // to run tests including dependency tests, a specific profile can be specified by make PROFILES=nodeps
```

## Release
Follow instructions in [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)
